/**
 * What a numeric predicate CLAIMS is a function of the slot it was read out of.
 *
 * A bound in a guard slot is part of the antecedent that decides where a requirement is
 * live; the same bound in the response is the obligation it imposes there. The tier
 * reports the role in `evidence.numeric.predicates[].slot`, so the stamp is output bytes
 * and a caller cannot hand over a slot the extractor then relabels.
